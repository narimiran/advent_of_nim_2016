I'm a complete beginner when it comes to [Nim programming language](https://nim-lang.org/).

These tasks are my first steps with Nim, so any advice how to improve my solutions is very welcome.

The tasks are available at [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016). If you're not registered, you'll be able to see only the first part of each task.

All solutions are based on [my Python solutions](https://github.com/narimiran/advent_of_code_2016).
